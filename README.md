# LDR-Analog-Sensor-
This Arduino-based project demonstrates how to use an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to control an LED based on ambient light levels. The LDR acts as an analog light sensor whose resistance changes with light intensity. This change is read by the Arduino through an analog input pin, which is then used to control an LED.
